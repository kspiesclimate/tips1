Pre-work Tip Calculator for Codepath
This application is an exercise to complete the application to Codepath's iOS for Designers bootcamp. There is not a huge investement on design nor a lot of complex code behind it, the exercise triest to touch

Time: I spent around 1 hour on the exercise

 Required: The user can calculate the tip, using diferent percentages
